I’m a **Senior Software Developer** based in **Siem Reap, Cambodia**, with a strong background in both the **technical and business** aspects of product development. With hands-on experience in **Ruby on Rails** and **React**, I specialize in building full-stack web applications that are scalable, efficient, and user-centered.

I’m passionate about bridging the gap between engineering and business strategy — turning complex challenges into practical, impactful solutions that drive real results. I value clean code, clean architecture, thoughtful design, modern development practices, team collaboration, and continuous learning to stay ahead in an ever-evolving tech landscape.

Outside of coding, I practice **Aikido** (a Japanese Bushido), which helps me stay grounded, focused, and balanced — qualities I bring into my work and everyday life.
